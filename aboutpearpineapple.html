    <div><h2 class="pc_l">Version 2.4.0</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the latest version of Fruity (Pineapple 2.4.0).</p>

        <h3>What's new?</h3>
        <p>We have rebranded Fruity Lemon into Fruity Pineapple!</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This new version includes "Mock Up Mode."</p>
        <p>Mock Up Mode allows users to load their websites into a browser window that lacks any buttons or branding. This is excellent for developers who are making promos for their web projects and for streamers who want a simple browser window for their streams.</p>


        <p></p>
        <h3>How to use the fast action bar:</h3>
        <p>This new version includes a new feature: a fast action bar.</p>
        <p>This bar can be found on the home page in the bottom left.</p>

        <h3>Setting up your favorite sites</h3>
        <p>Before you start using this feature, let's go over it briefly.</p>
        <p>There is 1 built in link (Author) and 3 customizable favorites. To start customizing, click on the little gear.</p>
        <img src="./img/about2.png" width="40%" alt="">
        <p>After selecting this gear, a menu like the one above will appear.</p>
        <p>Here is where you can edit your favorites' names and links.</p>
        <p>After you have saved your settings, select the gear again to dismiss the editing menu.</p>
        <p>- - -</p>
        <h3>Start up</h3>
        <img src="./img/about3.png" width="40%" alt="">
        <p>To make new favorites, select the gear and follow the instructions from the previous section.</p>
        <p>If the previous session's fast action settings do not load automatically, select the little hard drive in the corner.</p>
